### Building a full stack project as practice with different components of a Software System


##### Components used for this project are:

- React
- Python/Django
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker Compose

For getting started we need to have docker installed in our machine. Please install it if already not.

Now let's clone the project into our machine. Open terminal from the project directory where docker compose file is present and type: 

***docker compose up***

Now we will see all the components are getting ready to serve the system one by one.

After the completion of container creation we can go to our browser and visit the URL:

***localhost:3000***

This will load a very simple looking page where we will be able to see a form and we can create and delete items from this page.

All the user interaction can be seen in the terminal.

This is really a very simple project which showcases how components of a software systems work together. A lot of improvement scope is still there.

Thanks for your patient reading. Any constructive feedback is welcomed.

***Happy Coding***
